# RPS

This is a "Rock Paper and Scissors" game.

This game is case-sensitive and it only uses lowercase!

I didn't create an array.

I didn't use Math.floor() function.

I didn't use for loops.

Instead, I create a custom function called compare().

And I create a nested if-statement inside the function to determine whether player one will win or lose.

Check it out and have fun!
